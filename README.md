# dataEntry
This project is a data entry application using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and JSON for data storage. It allows users to input personal information, including first name, last name, title, age, nationality, registration status, and acceptance of terms and conditions. The entered data is then stored in a JSON file (users.json).
